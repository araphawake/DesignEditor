 ABOUT (DesignEditor)
**********************************

	This project was developed and last modified at 25th October 2015 by Rafael Azevedo Moscoso Silva Cruz 
	for the filière Man-Machine Interaction lectured by Eric Lecolinet at Télécom Paristech, Paris, France.
	All this is a product of an academic work (TP2) considering just educational aims.

	This version contains source files and project configuration files created using Qt Creator.
	Part of the code includes commentaries. Future releases with more comments and features will be added and distributed.

	This program allows the user to draw and paint geometric shapes and edit them at any time.
	The features to save and open files/drawings will be added in a future release.
	The POLYLINE is the only figure which cannot be moved later after the drawing has been finished.

	Remark: Future releases will be available on the GIT repository: https://github.com/araphawake
